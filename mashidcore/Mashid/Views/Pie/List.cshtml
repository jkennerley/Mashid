        are like web-forms controls, 
        are replaced by by tag-helpers 
        Limitation, is that if extra other data,
        create view paetil view with bigger model

    Hence => view-components
         1. crete class deries from ViewComponent
         2. [ViewComponent] attribute
         3. create class with name that ends with ViewComponent
    will have public IViewComponentResult invoke(){ return View(model) ;} method 
    It is not strictly necessary the viewComponent has a view, it may return string which is then inserted
    but can have a cshtml
    Typicall found in /Shared/Components
        
    *@
    @Html.Partial( "PieOverviewSummary" , pie)




}
